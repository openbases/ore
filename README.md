# Open Research Experiments

![docs/img/logo-small.png](https://github.com/openbases/openbases-python/raw/master/docs/img/logo-small.png)

The Journal of [Open Research Experiments]() (ORE) is an 
[Open Journals](https://openjournals.github.io) journal
to make it easy for researchers and developers to publish research experiments,
including comparisons, designs, and results.

**under development**

## Development

To build the docs:

```bash
cd src && make html
```

They are generated in [docs/html](docs/html)

The site will be generated programatically with a combination of CI and static
templates. More coming soon.

## Code of Conduct

In order to have a more open and welcoming community, ORE adheres to a code of 
conduct adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) 
code of conduct. This is also inherited from JOSS.
